# Lama's Stats
Because I'm tired of inconsistencies between different mods.  
Almost everything is togglable and can be disabled.  
By default this mod only serves as a QOL mod, but can be further expanded into an in-game noitool.

## Basic functions
* Show various stats on overlay or in hidden menu in a non-intrusive way, togglable by hotkey
* Show previous fungal shifts including results with flask
* Show fungal shift cooldown
* Show nearby and owned perks in a more convenient window (late-game QOL)
* Suicide button if you become too OP
## Predicting functions (turned off by default)
* Show next fungal shifts including flask resolutions
* Predict failed shifts including nested fails
* Show AP/LC recipes
* Show perks in next holy mountain
* Show perks reroll
* Show perk lottery result
* Show result of an always-cast perk
## Compatibility
* Should be compatible with most mods that adds perks or materials
* Should be loaded last (this mod only reads data from game)
* Now compatible with Apotheosis!
