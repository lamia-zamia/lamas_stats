# Lamas_stats
Because I'm tired of inconsistencies between different mods.
Almost everything is togglable and can be disabled.
By default this mod only serves as a QOL mod, but can be further expanded into an in-game noitool.
# Basic functions
* Show various stats on overlay or in hidden menu in a non-intrusive way, togglable by hotkey
* Show previous fungal shifts including a results with flask
* Show fungal shift cooldown
* Show nearby and owned perks in a more convenient window (late-game QOL)
# Predicting functions (turned off by default)
* Predict next fungal shifts including flask resolutions
* Show AP/LC recipes
* Predict perks in next holy mountain
* Predict perks reroll
* Predict perk lottery result
* Predict result of an always-cast perk
